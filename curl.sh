    "text": "Eddie was born in Olongapo City, a vibrant port town in the Philippines, where the waves of daily struggle often swallowed dreams before they could take shape. As the youngest of eight siblings, Eddie entered a world already scarred by hardship, coming into existence amid chaos and uncertainty. The fire that had destroyed his family’s livelihood had left a scar on their collective spirit, and the reverberations of that loss were felt in every corner of their home. His mother, though fiercely determined, could only do so much, while his father’s depression cast a long shadow over the family. Eddie’s arrival, at a time when hope seemed distant, would mark the beginning of a new chapter—but it was one that came with its own set of struggles. The loss was not only financial but also emotional, setting in motion a series of events that would alter the course of Eddie’s life before he had even taken his first breath. With their livelihood gone, Eddie’s parents found themselves caught in a spiral of financial troubles that seemed impossible to escape. The weight of their situation weighed heavily on their relationship. The constant strain of not knowing where their next meal would come from, and the fear of losing everything, led to constant arguments between them. The tension in the household grew, and the cracks in their marriage deepened. Unable to cope with the overwhelming sense of loss and hopelessness, Eddie’s father fell into a deep depression. He withdrew from the world, unable to find the strength to go on. The man who had once been a provider for his family now found himself unable to work or contribute. His absence cast a shadow over the family, and Eddie’s mother, the pillar of resilience, was left to pick up the pieces. In the face of adversity, Eddie’s mother became the sole breadwinner. Determined to ensure her children’s survival, she found work at a local club, singing to earn enough money to feed and clothe her family. It was a difficult and often degrading job, but her love for her children pushed her to endure the hardships. Each night, she would step into the club’s spotlight, singing with a mix of sorrow and hope, her voice carrying the weight of a mother’s love. It wasn’t the life she had envisioned, but it was the life she had to live to keep her family together."
