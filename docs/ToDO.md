It looks like your file upload was successful! ðŸŽ‰ The response includes a `success: true` status and a partial `url` of the uploaded file on Cloudinary.

---

### What to Do Next:

1. **Verify the Uploaded Image URL**:

   - Copy the full `url` from the response and open it in your browser to ensure the image is accessible.

2. **Use the URL in Your Application**:

   - Save the URL in your database or directly use it in your frontend to display the image.

3. **Example Frontend Display**:
   If you're working with a frontend, you can use the URL to display the uploaded image like this:

   ```html
   <img
     src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dt3mokrx9/image/upload/v173678..."
     alt="Uploaded Image"
   />
   ```
