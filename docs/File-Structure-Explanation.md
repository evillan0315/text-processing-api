- **server_setup.md**: Details on setting up the server for the application.

#### **middlewares**

- **corsConfig.js**: Configuration for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow resources to be shared across different domains.

#### **models**

- **User.js**: Mongoose model for user-related data in the database (e.g., username, password, etc.).
- **themes.json**: JSON file containing theme configurations, likely related to the user interface or application theme.

#### **routes**

- **authRoutes.js**: Routes related to user authentication.
- **resultRoutes.js**: Routes for accessing processed results.
- **testRoutes.js**: Routes intended for testing purposes, possibly endpoints for development.
- **textRoutes.js**: Routes for handling text-related operations like processing or analysis.
- **uploadRoutes.js**: Routes handling file uploads.

#### **services**

- **posTagger.js**: Service for Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging, likely part of text processing.
- **textProcessingService.js**: Service that processes text, potentially involving natural language processing (NLP) or other algorithms.

#### **testing**

- **structure.json**: A JSON file containing the file structure of the project, likely used for testing purposes.

#### **uploads**

- **output.json**: JSON file containing the processed output of uploaded files.

#### **utils**

- **cloudinary.js**: Utility file for interacting with Cloudinary's API.
- **jwt.js**: Utility file for generating or verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

### Key Files Overview

- **.env**: Essential for storing sensitive information like API keys and secret tokens.
- **generateStructure.js**: Automatically generates the project structure, which can be useful for documentation or validation.
- **server.js**: The backbone of the application, initializing the express server and routing.
- **package.json**: Contains metadata about the project, including dependencies and scripts.
- **README.md**: Essential for understanding the purpose of the project, setup instructions, and general information.

This structure seems well-organized, separating logic into controllers, services, models, routes, and utilities for easy maintenance and scalability.
